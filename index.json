Both allopolyploids and hybrids show hybrid vigor or heterosis. The phenomenon has been widely applied in agriculture and extensively studied at the genetic and gene expression levels. However, proteomic changes in hybrids and polyploids remain poorly understood. Here, we report comparative analysis of soluble and insoluble proteomes in Arabidopsis intraspecific and interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids formed between A. thaliana and A. arenosa. Both allotetraploids and intraspecific hybrids displayed nonadditive expression (unequal to the sum of the two parents) of the proteins, most of which were involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses. In the allotetraploids, homoeolog-expression bias was not observed among all proteins examined but could occur among 17-20% of the nonadditively expressed proteins, consistent with the transcriptome results. Among expression-biased homoeologs, there were more A. thaliana-biased than A. arenosa-biased homoeologs,. Analysis of the insoluble and soluble proteomes revealed more soluble proteins in the hybrids than their parents but not in the allotetraploids. Most proteins in ribosomal biosynthesis and in the thylakoid lumen, membrane, and stroma were in the soluble fractions, indicating a role of protein stability in photosynthetic activities for promoting growth. These results collectively support roles of nonadditive expression of stress-responsive proteins and increased solubility of photosynthetic proteins in Arabidopsis hybrids and allotetraploids, which may promote hybrid vigor.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Protein nonadditive expression and solubility in Arabidopsis hybrids and allotetraploids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Praveen Kumar Kathare","Ruijiao Xin","Abirama Sundari Ganesan","Viviana June","Anireddy S.

The red/far-red light‚Äìabsorbing phytochromes (phys) modulate these aspects by intricately regulating gene expression at multiple levels. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of an RNA-binding splicing factor, SWAP1 (SUPPRESSOR-OF-WHITE-APRICOT/SURP RNA-BINDING DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN1). Loss-of-function swap1-1 mutant is hyposensitive to red light and exhibits a day length‚Äìindependent early flowering phenotype. SWAP1 physically interacts with two other splicing factors, (SFPS) SPLICING FACTOR FOR PHYTOCHROME SIGNALING and (RRC1) REDUCED RED LIGHT RESPONSES IN CRY1CRY2 BACKGROUND 1 in a light-independent manner and forms a ternary complex. In addition, SWAP1 physically interacts with photoactivated phyB and colocalizes with nuclear phyB photobodies. Phenotypic analyses show that the swap1sfps, swap1rrc1, and sfpsrrc1 double mutants display hypocotyl lengths similar to that of the respective single mutants under red light, suggesting that they function in the same genetic pathway. The swap1sfps double and swap1sfpsrrc1 triple mutants display pleiotropic phenotypes, including sterility at the adult stage. Deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses show that SWAP1 regulates the gene expression and pre‚Äìmessenger RNA (mRNA) alternative splicing of a large number of genes, including those involved in plant responses to light signaling. A comparative analysis of alternative splicing among single, double, and triple mutants showed that all three splicing factors coordinately regulate the alternative splicing of a subset of genes. Our study uncovered the function of a splicing factor that modulates light-regulated alternative splicing by interacting with photoactivated phyB and other splicing factors.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"SWAP1-SFPS-RRC1 splicing factor complex modulates pre-mRNA splicing to promote photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"8e4e1d0ce7692c15c2525f971214826d","permalink":"https://example.com/_index_backup/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/_index_backup/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Viviana June","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Protein interaction networks often suggest protein functions and open new avenues to characterize genes and proteins. We therefore systematically determined protein complexes from 13 plant species of scientific and agricultural importance, greatly expanding the known repertoire of stable protein complexes in plants. By using co-fractionation mass spectrometry, we recovered known complexes, confirmed complexes predicted to occur in plants, and identified previously unknown interactions conserved over 1.1 billion years of green plant evolution. Several novel complexes are involved in vernalization and pathogen defense, traits critical for agriculture. We also observed plant analogs of animal complexes with distinct molecular assemblies, including a megadalton-scale tRNA multi-synthetase complex. The resulting map offers a cross-species view of conserved, stable protein assemblies shared across plant cells and provides a mechanistic, biochemical framework for interpreting plant genetics and mutant phenotypes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A pan-plant protein complex map reveals deep conservation and novel assemblies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pallavi Kompella","Brant Gracia","Lucy LeBlanc","Shelly Engelman","Chinmayee Kulkarni","Niral Desai","Viviana June","Stephen March","Sarah Pattengale","Gabriel Rodriguez-Rivera","Seung Woo Ryu","Isabel Strohkendl","Pooja Mandke","Greg Clark"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585526400,"objectID":"47555fb3f718df0e3c5b9d7f139e7e75","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/scifair-journal-article/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/scifair-journal-article/","section":"publication","summary":"Science communication and outreach are essential for training the next generation of scientists and raising public awareness for science. Providing effective science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educational outreach to students in classrooms is challenging because of the need to form partnerships with teachers, the time commitment required for the presenting scientist, and the limited class time allotted for presentations. In our Present Your Ph.D. Thesis to a 12-Year Old outreach project, our novel solution to this problem is hosting a youth science workshop (YSW) on our university campus. The YSW is an interpersonal science communication and outreach experience in which graduate students from diverse scientific disciplines introduce middle and high school students to their cutting-edge research and mentor them to develop a white-board presentation to communicate the research to the workshop audience. Our assessment of the YSW indicated that participating young students expressed significantly more positive attitudes toward science and increased motivation to work in a STEM career after attending the workshop. Qualitative follow-up interviews with participating graduate students‚Äô show that even with minimal time commitment, an impactful science communication training experience can be achieved. The YSW is a low-cost, high-reward educational outreach event amenable to all disciplines of science. It enhances interest and support of basic science research while providing opportunities for graduate students to engage with the public, improve their science communication skills, and enhance public understanding of science. This YSW model can be easily implemented at other higher education institutions to globally enhance science outreach initiatives.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Interactive Youth Science Workshops benefit student participants and graduate student mentors","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Heterosis is a phenomenon in which offspring grow larger and stronger than either parent. Despite the widespread use of hybrid plants in agriculture, the underlying mechanism of heterosis has yet to be explained. Furthermore, there is a parent-of-origin effect on heterosis, where reciprocal hybrids show uneven levels of hybrid vigor.\nIn the first part of my thesis research, I investigated the hypothesis that increased heterozygosity results in growth vigor through a decrease in protein aggregation by fractionating the proteome of intraspecific and interspecific Arabidopsis hybrids and using LC-MS to survey the proteome. I also used these experiments to evaluate nonadditive protein expression in these hybrids. I found that there is nonadditive expression of proteins related to stress response in Arabidopsis intraspecific hybrids and interspecific allotetraploids, and that there is minimal change to protein solubility in these plants, indicating that it is unlikely to be a major contributor to heterosis.\nIn the second part of my thesis research, I employed cytoplasmic-nuclear substitution lines to investigate the contribution of the cytoplasmic genomes and genetic imprinting to the parent-of-origin effect on hybrid vigor. I used laser capture microdissection followed by RNA sequencing to identify changes in gene expression, as well as imprinted genes in the endosperm and embryo of reciprocal hybrids that differed in their cytoplasmic genomes or in their patterns of imprinting. I found that genetic imprinting, rather than the cytoplasmic genomes, is the primary contributor to the parent-of-origin effect in intraspecific Arabidopsis hybrids, with many genes differentially expressed between reciprocal hybrids with fixed cytoplasmic genomes, but very few differentially expressed genes when imprinting was fixed. Furthermore, I was able to identify imprinted genes using these hybrids, as well as established imprinted genes that lose biased expression in crosses between Col and C24.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"707c0755d9f86e71d547935e98a0ba23","permalink":"https://example.com/project/heterosis-research/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/heterosis-research/","section":"project","summary":"My PhD thesis research focused on the molecular biology underlying heterosis in Arabidopsis thaliana","tags":["Genetics"],"title":"Heterosis Research","type":"project"},{"authors":["Piotr A.

Sequence differences between homologs can locally inhibit crossovers. Despite this, nucleotide diversity and population-scaled recombination are positively correlated in eukaryote genomes. To investigate interactions between heterozygosity and recombination we crossed Arabidopsis lines carrying fluorescent crossover reporters to 32 diverse accessions and observed hybrids with significantly higher and lower crossovers than homozygotes. Using recombinant populations derived from these crosses we observed that heterozygous regions increase crossovers when juxtaposed with homozygous regions, which reciprocally decrease. Total crossovers measured by chiasmata were unchanged when heterozygosity was varied, consistent with homeostatic control. We tested the effects of heterozygosity in mutants where the balance of interfering and non-interfering crossover repair is altered. Crossover remodeling at homozygosity-heterozygosity junctions requires interference, and non-interfering repair is inefficient in heterozygous regions. As a consequence, heterozygous regions show stronger crossover interference. Our findings reveal how varying homolog polymorphism patterns can shape meiotic recombination.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Juxtaposition of heterozygous and homozygous regions causes reciprocal crossover remodelling via interference during Arabidopsis meiosis","type":"publication"}]
