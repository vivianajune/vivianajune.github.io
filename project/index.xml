      <title>Science Outreach and Education</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In graduate school, I became involved in a number of science outreach projects. I was involved with the UT Austin Present Your PhD to a middle schooler project, where graduate students present their thesis research to middle school classrooms as well as run a Kid&amp;rsquo;s Science Workshop once a year. This was a great opportunity to practice communicating science to diverse audiences, as well as gave local students the opportunity to engage with cutting edge research at UT Austin. We also conduct research into the effect of this research on the students we work with, and published a paper on the effect of our workshops in PLoS Biology in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also involved with the platform PlantingScience which pairs scientist mentors with classrooms to guide them through a few weeks of experiments related to a topic in plant science. I have been involved with PlantingScience both as a mentor and as a member of the Master Plant Science Team where I managed teams of mentors. PlantingScience provides the unique opportunity to work with students over several weeks - it&amp;rsquo;s always great seeing them learn and grow over the course of their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heterosis Research</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My thesis focused on the genetics and molecular biology of heterosis in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Heterosis is a phenomenon in which offspring grow larger and stronger than either parent. Despite the widespread use of hybrid plants in agriculture, the underlying mechanism of heterosis has yet to be explained. Furthermore, there is a parent-of-origin effect on heterosis, where reciprocal hybrids show uneven levels of hybrid vigor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of my thesis research, I investigated the hypothesis that increased heterozygosity results in growth vigor through a decrease in protein aggregation by fractionating the proteome of intraspecific and interspecific Arabidopsis hybrids and using LC-MS to survey the proteome. I also used these experiments to evaluate nonadditive protein expression in these hybrids. I found that there is nonadditive expression of proteins related to stress response in Arabidopsis intraspecific hybrids and interspecific allotetraploids, and that there is minimal change to protein solubility in these plants, indicating that it is unlikely to be a major contributor to heterosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second part of my thesis research, I employed cytoplasmic-nuclear substitution lines to investigate the contribution of the cytoplasmic genomes and genetic imprinting to the parent-of-origin effect on hybrid vigor. I used laser capture microdissection followed by RNA sequencing to identify changes in gene expression, as well as imprinted genes in the endosperm and embryo of reciprocal hybrids that differed in their cytoplasmic genomes or in their patterns of imprinting. I found that genetic imprinting, rather than the cytoplasmic genomes, is the primary contributor to the parent-of-origin effect in intraspecific Arabidopsis hybrids, with many genes differentially expressed between reciprocal hybrids with fixed cytoplasmic genomes, but very few differentially expressed genes when imprinting was fixed. Furthermore, I was able to identify imprinted genes using these hybrids, as well as established imprinted genes that lose biased expression in crosses between Col and C24.&lt;/p&gt;
